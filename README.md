# Cat-Dog-Classifier-transfer-learning
A cat-dog classifier is a machine learning model that is designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. To build such a classifier, we can make use of a Kaggle dataset that contains a large number of images of cats and dogs. Transfer learning can be used to train the model more efficiently and effectively.

One of the popular transfer learning modules for image classification is MobileNet. MobileNet is a deep neural network architecture that is optimized for mobile devices, and it is relatively lightweight and fast. We can use the pre-trained weights of MobileNet as a starting point to train our cat-dog classifier.
